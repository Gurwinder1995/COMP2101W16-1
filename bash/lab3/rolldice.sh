# this script gets 2 numbers from the user
#   a count of dice and a count of sides per die
#   it prints out the results of rolling those dice

# Variables
###########
# default of 2 dice
# default of 6 sides to a die
# start the total rolled at zero

# Main
######
# ask the user how many dice they want to roll

# use what they gave us if it is a number from 1-5

# ask the user how many sides these dice have

# use what they gave us if it is a number from 4-20

# loop through the dice, rolling them and summing the rolls

    # the roll range is based on the number of sides
    
    # add the current roll total to the running total
    
    # give the user feedback about the current roll
    
    # the loop will end when the count of dice to roll reaches zero

# done rolling, display the sum of the rolls
