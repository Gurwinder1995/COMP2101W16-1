# this script will ask the user for a random number

# we need a random number for them to guess between 1 and 10

# since our loop will be controlled by their guess,
#   start with an incorrect guess

# Main
######

# we aren't done until the user guesses our number
#   so keep asking in a loop until they get it right

    # get a number from them
    
    # ask them over and over if they didn't give us something that looks like it might be valid    while [[ ! "$guess" =~ ^[1-9]0*$ ]]; do
    
    # give them feedback about their guess if it was wrong

# loop ended, so they got it right, let them know
