# this script shows the user the files in their home directory,
#   lets them pick one using a menu,
#   then displays it using the more command

# build an array of files using the find command
# use the find command to find non-empty regular files in the user's home directory

# use a loop to ask for a choice so that we can ask again if necessary

    # display the files as a menu, with a number in front of each

    # display a prompt, asking the user to pick a valid menu number

    # make sure they gave us a number
        # make sure that the number they gave us is valid
            # use the "more" command to display the content of the file
            # allow them to choose another file

    # if they didn't give us a valid number,
    #    let them know that they messed up and go back through the loop
