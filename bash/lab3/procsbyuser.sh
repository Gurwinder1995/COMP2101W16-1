# this script summarizes the number of processes 
#     by user and warns us if the user named 
#     nobody has processes running

# Variables
###########
# we will put the process counts into a hash keyed using the username

# Main
######
# use the ps command to generate a list of processes, displaying only the username that owns each process
    
    # each output line from the ps command has just a username
    # so use that to add 1 to the count of processes for that user
    # rely on the fact that the first time you assign a value to a variable,
    #   it is treated like the variable had a zero in it

# loop through our hash of counts to display the results

    # display the username and count for that user

# display the count specifically for the user "nobody" if they have a count in the hash
