#!/bin/bash

# This script demonstrates how to trap signals and handle them using functions

#### Variables

#### Functions

# The error-message function will send an error message to stderr
# Usage:
#   error-message ["some text to print to stderr"]
#

# The usage function will display command syntax
#

# Normally traps catch signals and do something useful or necessary with them
# These functions are for use with traps for signals we want to catch
# Quit if we get SIGQUIT, but let the user know why we are exiting
# Squawk if we get SIGHUP
# If we get SIGINT, we reset the counter to where it started

# trap the signals we care about and use them to invoke the functions above

#### Main Program

# Process command line parameters

# display what is left in our count
# sleep until it is time for the next display
# end the script when the count reaches zero
